### Who is this book for?

The goal of this book is not to turn you into a professional software developer. The goal of this book is to turn those who work with computers (specifically in libraries) to learn the basics of programming so that you can automate simple repetitive tasks such as

* move those vendor files and sort them in directories
* downloading files from websites when updated
* manipulating log files
* formatting spreadsheets

All these are simple and oft involved activities but aren't significant enough for professional software developers to create ready solutions. If in the process of reading this programming becomes something that interests you then all the better.

### What is Programming?

All computer programs use simple instructions that when combined can create complicated programs. In a nutshell computer programming involves breaking down problems into the simplest of building blocks. For this book we will be using the Python programming language. We will be learning the syntax rules of this programming language.
